# Inbreker_detector_7000  
🛡️ The Ultimate Intrusion Prevention System

## 🔐 What is the Inbreker Detector 7000?

The **Inbreker Detector 7000** is our own smart security system, developed as the professional successor to the Inbreker Detector 5000.  
The system combines multiple microcontrollers — including a **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino**, and **ESP32** — to create a powerful, flexible, and reliable security platform.

The 7000 version runs on **SecureWatch OS**, a lightweight operating system optimized for security applications and real‑time detection.

## 🔧 How does the system work?

- **Sensors** detect movement, sound, and other suspicious activity.  
- An **Arduino** reads the sensors at high speed.  
- The **ESP32** handles wireless communication and fast responses.  
- The **Raspberry Pi** acts as the central controller running SecureWatch OS.  

When a detection occurs, the system can:
- activate an alarm  
- send an email notification  
- log data for later analysis  

Together, these components form one integrated and intelligent security system.

## 🎯 Our goals

- Develop a better and more professional successor to the Inbreker Detector 5000.  
- Build a **safe, stable, and reliable** security system.  
- Create a **modular platform** that can easily be expanded with new sensors and features.  
- Optimize SecureWatch OS for **fast detection** and **minimal delay**.
